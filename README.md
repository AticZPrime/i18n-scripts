## Billy's scripts internationalization

Here you can contribute to the internationalization of my scripts.

Click a script's folder to show all of its language files.

Most of them will contain a table showing phrases on the left and their translations on the right.

Use the English file as a reference to what you need to be translating.

Some translations will have `\n`, `%s` and `\"`. Please try to retain these when translating.

I recommend that you use a syntax highlighter while editing to make sure you make no syntax mistakes.

If you want to contribute to the translation of a language that doesn't have a file simply create the file.

##Where is `x` script?

At the moment I'm only accepting translations for specific scripts until I recode them or add internationalization capabilities to them.
